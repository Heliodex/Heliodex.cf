			<p>
				Litecode is a deterministic virtual machine, execution server,
				and library toolkit for <a

					Luau.
				</a>
				It's useful as a server for remotely running Luau scripts or as

				Litecode is part of the coputer project, a decentralised and

			<h2>Mercury Core</h2>

			<p>
				Mercury Core is the ultimate community-driven secure, flexible,
				and stable foundation for the future of your MMO game creation
				platform, allowing for easy customisation or complete overhaul
				and possible integration with multiple clients and external
				services.
				<br />
				If you donâ€™t know what any of those things are, Mercury Core is a
				build-your-own-Roblox.
			</p>
			<p>
				Built from the foundations of Mercury 2, Mercury Core is set up
				by cloning the repository. Check it out at
				<a

			<h2>Mercury</h2>

			<p>
				Mercury 2 is a project built to revive and recreate the
				experience of old versions of a popular MMO game. Similar to the
				previous version of Mercury, though with a completely rewritten
				website and backend, providing more stability and security, as
				well as a whole host of new features.
			</p>
			<p>
				Mercury 2 is the largest project I've worked on, and concluded
				in June 2024 with the announcement of its pivot and rebranding
				to Mercury Core. You can visit the website at
				<a

			<h2>eChat</h2>

			<p>
				eChat is a messaging application, built as the successor to a
				previous project, DocSocial, and also designed to be used during
				school without getting caught. It was built with <a
					href="https://svelte.dev/"
					target="_blank"
					rel="noopener noreferrer">
					Svelte
				</a>
				and
				<a
					href="https://centrifugal.dev/"
					target="_blank"
					rel="noopener noreferrer">
					Centrifugo.
				</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				The app was made to work in a bookmarklet, and the popup would
				appear on the page upon clicking the bookmark.
			</p>
			<p>
				The original server will likely no longer be online, but both
				server and client have been open-sourced at
				<a

			<h2>DocSocial</h2>

			<p>
				DocSocial is a free, simple messaging application. It was
				designed to appear like a Google document from a quick glance,
				or from a look at your browser history.
			</p>
			<p>
				DocSocial uses
				<a
					href="https://scaledrone.com/"
					target="_blank"
					rel="noopener noreferrer">
					Scaledrone
				</a>
				for its backend and for transferring messages.
			</p>
			<p>
				It was designed to work best with one specific device and OS,
				our school-assigned chromebooks, so pupils could chat with
				others in class and not be caught by a teacher.

			<h2>Crazy Calculations</h2>

			<p>
				Crazy Calculations is a simple maths game that tests you through
				10 levels of increasingly difficult maths questions.
				<br />
				It was programmed in about a week for a Computer Science class assignment,
				where a video had to be recorded explaining the project.
				<br />
				The project was started on 23 September 2021, and submitted on 4
				October 2021.
			</p>
			<p>
				The game was inspired by (and much of the code ported from)
				<a
					href="https://www.tomscott.com/usvsth3m/maths/"
					target="_blank"
					rel="noopener noreferrer">
					You Can't Do Simple Maths Under Pressure
				</a>
				by UsVsTh3m.

			<h2>PF Range Calculator</h2>

			<p>
				This is a small web tool designed to calculate how far weapons
				in the game Phantom Forces by StyLiS Studios deal a certain
				amount of damage to.
				<br />
				You can input some values provided by the in-game statistics, and
				the tool will calculate how far it will deal that damage to.
			</p>
			<p>
				This was created by me in a few days, after I realised how long
				it would take to calculate all the range values manually.
				<br />
				I remade the site a few months later, being my first time using Svelte.
				<br />
				You can find the calculator at

			<h2>Sprig Shooter</h2>

				Sprig shooter is a game for the <a

					target="_blank"
					rel="noopener noreferrer">
					Hack Club Sprig,
				</a>
				a small handheld game console. While the engine usually uses a tile-based
				approach, the game uses a raster-based renderer for more graphical
				freedom. Creating the game was a fun challenge, and the console was
				delivered to me shortly after it was complete.
			</p>
			<p>
				Shoot enemies while avoiding them to get the highest score, and
				the game steadily gets more difficult with higher scores. Sprig
				Shooter is playable at

			<h2>Typing Tester</h2>

			<p>
				Typing Tester is a game that helps to improve your typing
				accuracy, stamina, and speed. It was released on 25 December
				2022 after sixteen months of feature creep.
				<br />
				Type words to earn experience and typing tokens, level up and earn
				ranks, and use typing tokens to buy new wordlists!

			<h2>Python Calculator Collection</h2>

			<p>
				This is a collection of calculator programs I wrote on my
				calculator's python interpreter during maths classes.
				<br />
				There are programs for calculating interest over time, areas or volumes
				of polytopes, angles of arcs of circles, and much more.
			</p>
			<p>
				I cannot guarantee the accuracy of these programs, but while
				they
				<em>should</em>
				be decently accurate, please submit an issue to the repo if you find
				an error in any of the programs.
				<br />
				They are available at

			<h2>HybridOS</h2>

			<p>
				HybridOS was an open-source Python3 'meta-program'.
				<br />
				I avoid calling it an operating system, because it's not an operating
				system, it was originally written in Python.
			</p>
			<p>
				HybridOS was worked on from mid- to late-2019 as a fusion of two
				similar programs, BlakBird by me, and Vortex by Taskmanager. (
				<a
					href="https://taski.ml/"
					target="_blank"
					rel="noopener noreferrer">
					taski.ml
				</a>
				)
				<br />
				The program has a total line count of more than 1,100, and had features
				such as a multi-user signup and login system, a number of games and
				useful applications, plenty of colourful ASCII art, and a root admin
				system.
				<br />
				HybridOS was ported to many different languages, including C, C++,
				Java, C# (twice), and Batch. Even linux distros were made as well!
			</p>
			<p>
				HybridOS was largely abandoned after the beginning of 2020, and
				the code for the first Python version has been released on my
				Github page.
				<br />
